### LangChain

[LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) is a framework for developing LLM-driven applications, designed to assist developers in building end-to-end applications using LLM.

With the components and interfaces provided by LangChain, developers can easily design and build various LLM-powered applications such as question-answering systems, summarization tools, chatbots, code comprehension tools, information extraction systems, and more.

### privateGPT

[privateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT) is an open-source project based on [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) and [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) among others. It aims to provide an interface for localizing document analysis and interactive Q&A using large models. Users can utilize privateGPT to analyze local documents and use GPT4All or llama.cpp compatible large model files to ask and answer questions about document content, ensuring data localization and privacy.
